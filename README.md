# ðŸš– Uber Trip Analysis â€“ Power BI Project  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  

This project is a real-time Uber Trip Analysis built in Power BI to provide business intelligence insights for stakeholders. The dataset covers 103,000+ trips from New York City (June 2024) and was modeled, transformed, and visualized using Power BI best practices.  

The project simulates a real-world scenario where Uber operations teams need to monitor:  

- Trip demand patterns,  
- Revenue performance,  
- Trip efficiency (time & distance), and  
- High-demand locations.  

The deliverable includes three dashboards:  

- **Overview Analysis** â€“ Business-level KPIs & high-level summaries.  
- **Time Analysis** â€“ Demand fluctuations across hours, days, and weeks.  
- **Details Tab** â€“ Record-level insights with drill-through and export capabilities.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation & Modeling  

**Data Sources Used:**  
- **Trip Details Table** (103,728 rows, 11 columns) containing fields like Pickup Time, Drop-off Time, Passenger Count, Distance, Fare, Surge Fee, Vehicle Type, Payment Type.  
- **Locations Table** with pickup & drop-off zone mappings (used for relationships).  

**Modeling Approach:**  
- Designed a star schema with Trip Details as fact table and Locations as dimension.  
- Managed both active (pickup) and inactive (drop-off) relationships.  
- Used `USERELATIONSHIP()` in DAX to activate drop-off relationships only when needed.  
- Built a Calendar table for time-based slicing & filtering.  

**Key Transformations & Enrichments:**  
- Created calculated columns for Day/Night classification, Trip Duration, Weekday/Weekend segmentation.  
- Implemented a Measure Selector (Disconnected Table) for dynamic KPIs across dashboards.  
- Applied Dynamic Titles for auto-contextual chart headers.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights from Uber Trip Analysis  

### Demand Concentration & Location Hotspots  
- Penn Station emerged as the busiest pickup point, confirming it as a high-frequency hub for both commuters and tourists.  
- The Upper East Side North dominated as the top drop-off point, overlapping with frequent pickup activity.  
- Two-way demand corridors (Penn Station â†” Upper East Side) were detected, which minimize driver idle time and support efficient fleet positioning.  

### Day vs. Night Split  
- 70% of trips occur during the day, aligning with office commutes and mid-day errands.  
- 30% of trips happen at night, which, although smaller in volume, show higher average fares due to surge pricing and longer ride distances.  
- **Business Implication** â†’ Strong case for late-night driver incentives and safety-focused features.  

### Outlier Detection  
- The farthest trip logged was 144 miles (Lower Side â†’ Crown Heights North), far above the average trip length.  
- A small cluster of extreme long-distance rides significantly increases revenue but distorts average KPIs.  
- **Recommendation** â†’ Segment reporting into short-haul (0â€“10 mi), mid-haul (10â€“30 mi), long-haul (30+ mi) for clearer performance tracking.  

### Payment Preferences  
- Card payments dominate, but cash transactions still account for a sizable share.  
- Digital wallets (Uber Pay, Amazon Pay) show adoption, but penetration remains lower.  
- **Business Implication** â†’ Uber can incentivize digital payments (discounts, reward points) to reduce cash handling risks and improve transaction speed.  

### Trip Efficiency  
- Average trip distance: ~6â€“7 miles.  
- Average trip time: ~18â€“22 minutes.  
- Efficiency metrics help establish baselines for driver performance monitoring and customer experience benchmarking.  

### Revenue Optimization by Vehicle Type

- Uber Black & Comfort serve fewer trips but generate 2â€“3x higher booking value per ride.  
- **Business Implication** â†’ Supply-demand balance between budget vs. premium vehicles is crucial for maximizing profit margins.  

### Time-Based Demand Patterns  
- Peak Hours: 7â€“9 AM & 5â€“8 PM (commute).  
- Weekend Peaks: Higher demand late nights (Friâ€“Sun).  
- **Recommendation** â†’ Use time-based dynamic pricing and driver shift alignment to maximize availability and minimize unfulfilled ride requests.  

### Booking Trends Over the Month  
- Daily bookings showed a gradual upward trend throughout June 2024, reflecting increased adoption.  
- A few mid-week dips indicate lower business activity vs. weekend spikes.  
- **Insight** â†’ Helps Uber anticipate seasonality and weekday-weekend demand shifts.  

### Customer Behavior & Preferences  
- Higher multi-passenger trips on weekends point to leisure/social rides.  
- Weekday trips mostly single-passenger commutes.  
- **Suggestion** â†’ Uber could bundle promotions for group trips during weekends to maximize utilization.  

## Project Learning & Takeaways

While the problem statement provided the overall structure, all visuals, KPIs, and interactivity in Power BI were created by me. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with:  

- **Data Importing & Cleaning:** Handling real-world data inconsistencies and preparing datasets for analysis.  
- **Data Modeling:** Creating relationships, managing active/inactive relationships, and structuring data for efficient reporting.  
- **DAX Measures:** Writing advanced DAX formulas for dynamic calculations, aggregations, and conditional metrics.  
- **Dashboard Design & Interactivity:** Building responsive visuals, interactive slicers, dynamic chart titles, bookmarks, and drill-through functionalities.  
- **Analytical Thinking:** Translating business questions into measurable KPIs and actionable insights.  
- **Reporting Best Practices:** Designing dashboards for clear communication to stakeholders, ensuring usability and data-driven decision support.  
- **Hands-on Power BI Experience:** Practicing end-to-end dashboard developmentâ€”from raw data to advanced analyticsâ€”strengthening confidence in building professional reports independently.
