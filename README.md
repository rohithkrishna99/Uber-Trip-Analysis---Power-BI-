## ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation & Modeling
**Data Sources Used**
- **Trip Details Table** (103,728 rows, 11 columns): Pickup Time, Drop-off Time, Passenger Count, Distance, Fare, Surge Fee, Vehicle Type, Payment Type.  
- **Locations Table**: Pickup & drop-off zone mappings.  

**Modeling Approach**
- Designed a **star schema** with Trip Details as fact table and Locations as dimension.  
- Managed both active (pickup) and inactive (drop-off) relationships.  
- Used `USERELATIONSHIP()` in DAX for drop-off analysis.  
- Built a **Calendar table** for time-based slicing & filtering.  

**Key Transformations & Enrichments**
- Calculated columns for **Day/Night classification**, **Trip Duration**, and **Weekday/Weekend segmentation**.  
- Implemented a **Measure Selector (Disconnected Table)** for dynamic KPIs.  
- Applied **Dynamic Titles** for context-aware chart headers.
